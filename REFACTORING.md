# TihoChat Server Refactoring

## Overview
The `server.js` file has been completely refactored into a modular, maintainable structure. The original monolithic file has been broken down into separate modules for better organization, security, and maintainability.

## New Structure

```
src/
├── config/
│   └── server.js          # Server configuration and setup
├── middleware/
│   └── auth.js            # Authentication and error handling middleware
├── routes/
│   ├── auth.js            # Authentication routes (login, registration, logout)
│   ├── room.js            # Room-related routes
│   ├── invite.js          # Invite system routes
│   └── profile.js         # User profile routes
├── services/
│   ├── database.js        # Database service layer
│   └── socketService.js   # Socket.IO service
└── utils/
    └── fileUtils.js       # File handling utilities
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Security Enhancements
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: All database queries now use parameterized queries instead of string concatenation
- **Input Validation**: Added middleware to sanitize and validate user inputs
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with proper error responses

### 2. Code Organization
- **Modular Structure**: Separated concerns into logical modules
- **Database Service Layer**: Centralized database operations with proper error handling
- **Route Separation**: Each route group is in its own file for better maintainability

### 3. Error Handling
- **Consistent Error Responses**: Standardized error handling across all routes
- **Graceful Degradation**: Proper error handling for database operations
- **Development vs Production**: Different error detail levels based on environment

### 4. File Structure
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Reusable Components**: Middleware and utilities can be easily reused
- **Easy Testing**: Modular structure makes unit testing easier

## Migration Guide

### Running the Refactored Server
To use the refactored server, update your package.json scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "devStart": "nodemon server-refactored.js"
  }
}
```

### Configuration
All configuration remains the same. The refactored server uses the same config files and environment variables.

### Database
The database schema remains unchanged. All existing functionality is preserved.

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Easier to find and modify specific functionality
2. **Security**: Protection against SQL injection and better input validation
3. **Scalability**: Modular structure makes it easier to add new features
4. **Testing**: Individual modules can be tested in isolation
5. **Code Reuse**: Common functionality is centralized in services and utilities

## Files Changed

- **Original**: `server.js` (404 lines)
- **New**: `server-refactored.js` + modular structure
- **Backup**: Original `server.js` is preserved

The refactored code maintains 100% backward compatibility while providing a much cleaner, more secure, and maintainable codebase.
